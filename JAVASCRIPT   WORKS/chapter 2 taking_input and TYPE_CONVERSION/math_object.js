//math = collection object that provides  a collection of properties and methods

// using Math properties

let x = -2;
let y = 2
let z =  4
// x = Math.round(x) so input is let x = 3.44; and output is 3
// x = Math.floor(x)  
// x = Math.ceil(x); so input is let x = 3.44; and output is 4 = round off the big value
// x = Math.trunc(x); so input is let x = 3.44; and output is 3 = the cut the decimal value
// x = Math.pow(x,y) so input is let x = 3;let y = 2 and output is 9 = they this power of value
//x = Math.sqrt(x); so input is let x = 9; and output is 3 = they square root of value 
//x = Math.log(x) so input is let x = 10; and output is 1 = they are logrithm 
//x = Math.sin(x) so input is let x = 45 and output is 0.345 = they are just tignomatri 
//x = Math.abs(x) so input is let x = -2 and output is 2 = they just convert the negative value to positive 
// x = Math.sign(x) so input is let -2 and output is -1 = they just show is what is lie on number line
// let max = Math.max(x,y,z); the show maximum number in group  
// let min = Math.min(x,y,z); the show minimum number in group
console.log(max);
