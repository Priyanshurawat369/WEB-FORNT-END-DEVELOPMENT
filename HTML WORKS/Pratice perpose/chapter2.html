    I am writing to bring to your attention a serious concern regarding the employment practices at Seema Dental College and Hospital, located in Virbhadra, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand. It has come to my attention that this institution has been engaging in illegal labor practices that exploit both temporary employees and faculty members, and also fails to provide gratuity benefits as required by law.

    Firstly, Seema Dental College and Hospital has a pattern of appointing temporary employees instead of offering permanent positions, thereby depriving workers of the rights and benefits associated with permanent employment. This practice is a clear violation of labor laws, which are in place to protect the rights of employees and ensure fair treatment. By continuously employing temporary workers, the college is able to evade its obligations towards employees and avoid providing them with appropriate benefits.
